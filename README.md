# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
(Using Python Libraries)

A simple and easy project that I made to get a basic understanding of working with APIs.I made a developer account on twitter and accessed the API Token and Keys used in this project.

I have used `BBCBreaking News` Twitter handle to analyse the sentiments of their tweets.

## Requirements
There are some general library requirements for the project and some which are specific to individual methods. The general requirements are as follows.

**_Please note: This is not a Machine learning/Deep learning project and has been made solely by using python libraries_**

- `tweepy`

- `pandas`

- `Regular Expressions Library`

- `TextBlob`

### Regex Library
A regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp; also referred to as rational expression) is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation. It is a technique developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory.
Regular expressions are used in search engines, search and replace dialogs of word processors and text editors, in text processing utilities such as sed and AWK and in lexical analysis. 

### TextBlob
A python library for processing textual data. it provides a simple API for diving into common natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, translation and more.
